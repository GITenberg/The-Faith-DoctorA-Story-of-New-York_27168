description: Published in 1891, this was Eggleston's final novel, before he turned
  his hand exclusively to history. Here Eggleston satirizes the wealthy followers
  of Christian Science and faith healing. The book was not written to depreciate anyone's
  valued delusions, he writes in his Preface, but to make a study of human nature
  under certain modern conditions.
